## Edge Detection

- Represents intensity change
- Outputs thin lines
- Inputs Grayscale image
- Used in feature detection

## Contours

- Represents Object shape & boundaries
- Outputs curved & closed boundaries
- Inputs binary image
- Used in object detection & tracking

## Color spaces

- **RGB** Red, Green, Blue
- **BGR** Blue, Green, Red
- **HSV** Hue, Saturation, Value
- **Grayscale** Single channel intensity
- **Binary** Only Pure Black & White

## Blur

- Denoises image
- Removes detail

### Blur types

- Gaussian Blur
- Median Blur
- Bilateral Blur
- Average Blur

## Histogram

- Represents pixel intensity distribution
- X-axis: Intensity values (0-255)
- Y-axis: Pixel count
- Can be used from separate channels

## Thresholding

- If image intensity threshold is lower than some value its black and higher its white
